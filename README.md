📘 Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier
📌 Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of the Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB) algorithm for classification tasks, especially suitable for text and discrete data.

Multinomial Naive Bayes is a probabilistic machine learning algorithm based on Bayes’ Theorem, and it models feature counts using a multinomial distribution, making it ideal for tasks like document classification and spam detection .

🎯 Objectives
Implement Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier
Work with discrete/count-based data
Perform text/data classification
Evaluate model performance
Understand probabilistic classification
🧠 Theory

Multinomial Naive Bayes assumes:

Features are independent
Data is represented as counts/frequencies (e.g., word counts)

It uses the multinomial probability distribution:

P(X)=
n
1
	​

!n
2
	​

!⋯n
m
	​

!
n!
	​

⋅p
1
n
1
	​

	​

p
2
n
2
	​

	​

⋯p
m
n
m
	​

	​


For classification:

P(C∣d)∝P(C)⋅
i
∏
	​

P(w
i
	​

∣C)
f
i
	​


Where:

w
i
	​

 = feature (word)
f
i
	​

 = frequency of feature
P(C) = prior probability

👉 The model predicts the class with the highest probability.
